### Overview
TwHIN-BERT is a new multi-lingual Tweet language model that is trained on 7 billion Tweets from over 100 distinct languages. TwHIN-BERT differs from prior pre-trained language models as it is trained with not only text-based self-supervision (e.g., MLM), but also with a social objective based on the rich social engagements within a Twitter Heterogeneous Information Network (TwHIN).

TwHIN-BERT can be used as a drop-in replacement for BERT in a variety of NLP and recommendation tasks. It not only outperforms similar models semantic understanding tasks such text classification), but also **social recommendation **tasks such as predicting user to Tweet engagement.

## 1. Pretrained Models

We initially release two pretrained TwHIN-BERT models (base and large) that are compatible wit the [HuggingFace BERT models](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).


| Model | Size | Download Link (ðŸ¤— HuggingFace) |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| TwHIN-BERT-base   | 280M parameters | [Twitter/TwHIN-BERT-base](https://huggingface.co/Twitter/twhin-bert-base) |
| TwHIN-BERT-large  | 550M parameters | [Twitter/TwHIN-BERT-large](https://huggingface.co/Twitter/twhin-bert-large) |


To use these models in ðŸ¤— Transformers:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('Twitter/twhin-bert-base')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('Twitter/twhin-bert-base')
inputs = tokenizer("I'm using TwHIN-BERT! #TwHIN-BERT #NLP", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
```
